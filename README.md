## Running the Code
- This was a project made for Logic in CS Course Assignment 1
- Compile by using `gcc -Wall -pg Task.c -o Task.exe`
- Then Run the exe
- You get the gmon file
- `gprof Task.exe gmon.out >> analysis.txt` Use this to get analysis
- To graph this in points use gprof2dot and graph

## Basic Git Commands you might want to know to push onto this repository
- `git pull`: to pull from remote
- `git add .`: to add your files
- `git commit -m "Message Goes here"`: Add Message for the commit
- `git push`: push files to remote

NOTE: Pushing Task.exe leads to merge conflicts :)
